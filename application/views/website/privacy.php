                        On certain Web pages or e-mails, <a href="wasihat.com/islamicwill.in" target="_blank"> <strong>wasihat.com/islamicwill.in </strong></a> may utilize a common Internet technology called a "Web beacon"
                        (also known as an "action tag" or "clear GIF technology"). Web beacons help analyze the effectiveness of Web sites by measuring,
