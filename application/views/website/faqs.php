                      <h3>What is an Islamic Will?</h3>
                      <p class="indent" > An Islamic Will is a legal document that is prepared to ensure that
                         your estate is distributed in accordance with Islamic law after your death.
                         Preparation of an Islamic Will requires careful drafting so that it is compliant
                         with the law of this country as well as Islamic law.
                      </p>
                      <p class="indent" >
                         A Will is a document which sets out what you want to happen to your assets after your death.
                        Your Will also states who is to be your executor. It is your executor who follows your wishes
                        which are set out in your Will and generally look after your estate after you die. Your Will details
                        who you wish to leave something to and what you want to leave to them.
                      </p>
                        <div class="border-top mt-3"></div><br>
                      <h3 class="padding-t-20">	What is the purpose of an Islamic Will?</h3>

                      <p class="indent"> The main purpose of an Islamic Will is to ensure that your estate is dealt with in accordance with Islamic law;
                        that it is distributed amongst specific family members in specific shares.</p>

                        <div class="border-top mt-3"></div><br>

                        <h3 class="padding-t-20">Who can make an Islamic Will?</h3>

                        <p class="indent"> Every Muslim major person who is sane and not feeble-minded squanderer may make a will to
                          dispose of his property, which must have made with free will and choice.</p>

                          <div class="border-top mt-3"></div><br>

                          <h3 class="padding-t-20">What are requiremenrts  of wasi?</h3>
                          <p class="indent"> He should be a mukallaf, i.e. a sane adult, because a lunatic and a minor do not have authority over themselves;
                            so there is no question of their exercising authority over the affairs of others. However, the Imamiyyah observe in
                            this regard: It is not valid for a child to act as an executor individually, though valid if he acts together with an
                            adult. Then the adult will execute the will individually till the minor attains majority, and then he will join him in
                           its execution.
                         </p>
                         <p class="indent">
                            The Hanafi state: If a minor is appointed as wasi (executor), the judge will replace him with another, and if the minor has
                           executed the will before being removed by the judge, his acts of execution of the will are valid and enforceable. Similarly,
                            if he attains majority before being removed, he will continue with the execution of the will (al-Fiqh
                             ‘ala al-madhahib al-'arba’ah and al-'Allamah al-Hilli’s al-Tadhkirah).
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           2. The wasi’s nomination must be determinate; thus if the testator appoints one of two persons without determining
                           which one of them is to be the executor, the appointment of both is void.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           3. The specification of the subject of will (musa bihi). Thus if the testator makes a will without specifying it
                           (as when he says: "So and so is my wasi", and does not mention the thing over which he is to exercise this authority),
                           the appointment is void according to the Imami, the Hanafi, the Shafi'i and the Hanbali schools. It has been narrated
                            from Malik that such a wasi will have authority over the whole estate.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           4. That the wasi be a Muslim: Thus it is not valid, as per consensus, for a Muslim to appoint a non-Muslim executor.
                            But the Hanafis state: If a Muslim appoints a non-Muslim, it is for the judge to replace him with a Muslim, though
                             the appointment itself will be considered valid. Hence if the non-Muslim wasiexecutes the will before his removal
                              by the judge, or becomes a Muslim, he will remain a wasi, as in the case of a minor.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           5. The Shafi'i school observes: It is wajib that the wasi be an 'adil person.
                            The Maliki, the Hanafi and researchers among the Imamiyyah state: It is sufficient
                            that he be trustworthy and truthful, because 'adalah is a means here and not an end,
                             and when the wasi strives to fulfil the provisions of the will - as is wajib for him -
                             the purpose is achieved. 10

                         </p>
                         <p>
                            The Hanbalis say: If the wasi is dishonest, the judge will appoint a trustworthy person as
                            a co-executor. This opinion is in consonance with the opinion of al-Sayyid al-Hakim in Minhaj al-salihin
                            (vol.2) where he observes: If a dishonest act is committed by the wasi, a trustworthy person will be appointed
                            alongside him to stop him from doing so. If this is not possible, he will be replaced by another.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           6. As reported in the third volume of al-Fiqh 'ala al-madhahib al-'arba’ah, ‘bab al-wasiyyah’,
                            the Hanafi, the Maliki and the Shafi'i schools require the wasi to be capable of executing the
                             provisions of the will.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                           Al-'Allamah al-Hilli has stated in al-Tadhkirah: Apparently, the view taken by our 'ulama', i.e.
                            the Imamiyyah, is that it is valid to appoint an executor incapable of executing the will, and his
                            incapacity will be compensated by the supervision of the hakim; i.e. the judge himself will supervise his
                             dispositions, or appoint a capable, trustworthy person to cooperate with the executor.
                         </p>

                         <p class="indent">As a Muslim, you should make an Islamic Will to clearly demonstrate that you wish your estate to be dealt
                            with in accordance with Islamic law. Making an Islamic Will ensures that your financial affairs are in order
                             and avoids any misunderstanding amongst your loved ones and any unnecessary legal issues at difficult time.</p>

                            A person who creates a will is called as “Testator”.

                            <h3 class="padding-t-20">Do I need to prepare a Declaration of Faith?</h3>
                          <p class="indent">Yes, this is encouraged amongst Muslims whilst finalising your wishes in your Will.
                            This can be prepared free of charge as part and parcel of preparing your Will.</p>

                            <p>A declaration of faith is a document where you declare certain true facts, in particular:-</p>

                            <p>•	That there is nothing worthy of worship but the one, the merciful, the almighty Allah</p>
                            <p>•	That He is the one God and has no partner</p>
                            <p>•	That the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the true and last messenger of all prophets before Him</p>
                            <p>•	That paradise is true and hell is true</p>
                            <p>•	That the Day of Judgment is true and shall come, and where Allah shall resurrect the dead</p>

                            <p class="indent">Yes, your funeral and burial wishes can be specified in your Will, however, it is recommended that
                              the funeral and burial wishes are discussed with the family beforehand, as the Will, sometimes, does not
                              come to light until after the funeral takes places.</p>

                            <h3 class="padding-t-20">Who will be my Executors and what do they do?</h3>
                            <p class="indent">Your Executors will be the persons you wish to deal with the administration of your estate after your death.
                               Your Executors (otherwise and in usual cases also your trustees) shall have the responsibility to ensure that
                               your estate is distributed in accordance with Islamic law. Your beneficiaries can also be your Executors.</p>

                               <p>It is your Executors’ responsibility to:-</p>
                               <p>•	Determine what property and other assets you own at the date of death, as well as your liabilities</p>
                               <p>•	arrange for current valuations of your personal possessions, property, investments any pension or insurance entitlements due including any debts and bills</p>
                               <p>•	arrange your funeral and arrange for the payment</p>
                               <p>•	establishing Income and Inheritance Taxes liabilities and completing the necessary tax returns for the Revenue</p>

                               <p>•	arrange to pay any legacies to legatees before the remainder of your estate is distributed in accordance with Islamic law</p>
                               <p>•	compiling detailed accounts to give to the main beneficiaries, before distribution of the estate and in accordance with Islamic law / Shariat law.</p>
                               <p>•	in the case of children being beneficiaries, then the Trustees shall hold the monies on trust until required then distribute</p>
                               <p class="indent">Choose your Executor(s) carefully as this can determine how quickly and efficiently the administration of your estate is progressed.
                                You should also consider appointing Professional Executors to deal with the administration and distribution of your estate and especially where you have more complex family or financial circumstances.   Examples of such circumstances include where you have children from previous marriages, potential contentious issues, if you have a business, numerous investment properties, and/or overseas assets.

                      <p class="indent"> Testamentary guardian is a person who is appointed as guardian of a minor under a will. Only father or,
                        in his absence, paternal grandfather has right to appoint a testamentary guardian. No special formality
                        is required for the appointment of a testamentary guardian, but, as obvious, such a person should be
                         competent to act as a guardian. A non-Muslim and a female may also be appointed as a testamentary.
                     </p>
                     <p class="indent">
                         In the absence of a natural and testamentary guardian, the court is empowered to appoint a guardian
                       for the purpose of the minor’s person or property or for both. The appointment of guardian by court
                       is governed by the Guardianship and Wards Act, 1890 which is applicable to all the Indians irrespective
                       of their religion. Such guardians are also called Statutory Guardian. It may be noted that no provision
                       has been made under this act for the guardianship for the marriage.

                        You can make minor alterations to your Will without having to rewrite a new Will by using a

                         If a small number of changes are required a codicil is an alternative to re-writing the entire Will.
                          However, at our competitive low cost fixed fee for an Islamic Will it usually makes more sense to have
                          it re-written, as it is likely to be quicker and cheaper for you.

                          them, i.e. if an individual is disinherited or inadequately provided for. Any claim allowed, would
                          be assessed by the Court.

                      <p class="indent">
                        If it was anticipated that such a claim could arise it might be advisable to
                        leave a letter to your Executor setting out any special circumstances relevant to any possible claim.

                      What happens if I do not make an Islamic Will?
                      </h3>
                      <p class="indent">
                        If you have not or do not make a valid Islamic Will before your death, then the Intestacy Rules will apply.
                        The law does not provide well for modern family situations and the Intestacy Rules are complicated,
                         but generally your surviving spouse will benefit in precedence to anyone else. However, they may not
                          receive all of your estate, depending on whether or not you have children. If you do not leave a
                           surviving spouse or children then the intestacy rules set out who will benefit from your estate
                           (depending on which of your relatives have survived you).
                      </p>

                      <p class="indent">
                        You may also end up having unnecessary and horrendously complicated statutory trusts of
                         intestacy, which will add to the legal costs of administering your estate.
                      </p>

                      <p class="indent">
                        If you have not made a valid Will then the law also sets out who is allowed to administer your estate,
                         and possibly not the personal representatives which you would have appointed.
                         If potential beneficiaries cannot be found then your estate will go to the Crown!

                        You can have a specialist Will drafted to protect your family home after death but if you wish to protect your

                         setting up a Home Protection Trust. For further information please contact us to speak to one of our specialist team.

                      This is encouraged amongst Muslims whilst finalizing the wishes in their Will. A declaration of faith
                         is a document where you proclaim certain true facts, in particular: That there is nothing worthy of
                         worship but the one, the merciful, the almighty Allah; That He is the one God and has no partner;
                          That the prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the true and last messenger of all prophets before Him

                      <p class="indent">
                      Under pure Islamic law a person who is to give effect to a will is called Executor (wasi).
                        Your Executors will be the persons you wish to deal with the administration of your estate
                         after your death. They shall have the responsibility of ensuring that your estate is distributed
                         in accordance with Islamic law. Your beneficiaries can also be your Executors. It is notnecessary for
                         a testator to appoint guardian or an administrator for his or her children, except when it is apprehended
                          that their property may perish

                      <h3  class="padding-t-20">When can I amend or revoke my Islamic will?</h3>
                      <p class="indent">
                        You can amend or revoke your Will at any time before your death. However,
                        there are some circumstances where a Will is automatically amended or revoked.
                        Upon divorce, a Will is altered insofar as any gift to a former spouse is rendered invalid.
                         Upon marriage (unless made in contemplation of the event), a Will is revoked. When a new Will is written,
                          the old Will should be destroyed to avoid any confusion at a later date.
                      </p>

                      <p class="indent">
                        We recommend that you review your Will every five years, or after any major life event such as birth,
                         death, marriage, divorce, separation, or moving house. We recommend that Wills are reviewed in order
                          to incorporate the changes.

                        	Joint assets are usually held either as ‘Joint Tenants’ or ‘Tenants in Common’.
                           If your assets are held as Joint Tenants, then upon death the assets shall pass
                           automatically to the survivor and not in accordance with your Islamic Will. If your
                           assets are held as Tenants in Common, then your share of those assets shall be passed
                           to beneficiaries in accordance with your Islamic Will.

                        If a bequest is made by a person under puberty, even though he is nearing puberty,
                        the will is unlawful but under Shafii law a will made by a person who has not attained
                        puberty would be valid if the will is made to a discrete or advisable purpose.
