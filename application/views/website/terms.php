                        <p class="indent">
                          We will do our best at the outset to give you an estimate of the likely overall cost in relation to a matter.
                           There are, of course, many variables which come into play and therefore we will provide you with an estimate based
                           upon the information we have at any particular stage.  Unless our Engagement Letter states otherwise, any estimate
                            or quotation of costs we give you is only a guide to assist you in budgeting and should not be regarded
                             as a website or a fixed or capped fee.  We shall do our best to notify you if any estimate of our time and/or
                              fees that we have given you needs to be changed as a result of a change in circumstances.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          If we are instructed by joint clients then all clients are jointly and severally liable for our fees,
                           notwithstanding any agreement between you as to how you will share the costs.  This means that we will
                           be able to look to one client only or to each of our clients to pay the whole of or any balance of any unpaid fees.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Our charges are primarily  based upon the time we spend dealing with your matter including meetings with you and others;
                           any time spent in travelling (for example, to and from Court or to meetings); and in such circumstances to be called as
                            witness in that case the user or its representative have to bare and pay all the traveling, accommodation, food and other
                             ancillary expenses considering, preparing and working on papers; correspondence (whether written or electronic);
                              and making and receiving telephone calls.  The hourly charging rate which
                               will apply will be confirmed in the Engagement Letter.  If there is to be a change in
                                the hourly rates applicable to your matter, you will be notified in writing and you will then be bound by them.
                                 If you do not accept the new rates after review, we reserve the right not to continue acting for you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          These rates take into account a number of factors which include the complexity of the issue, the speed at which action was to
                           be taken; the expertise or specialist knowledge which the case requires and, if appropriate, the value of the property or
                           subject matter involved.  Accordingly, the rate may be increased if, for example, the matter becomes more complex than expected.
                            If the scope of the work changes or our assumptions change, we will discuss a revised fee arrangement or estimate with you.
